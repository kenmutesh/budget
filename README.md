### PROJECT SETUP
1. Expense Splitting: Provide the ability to split expenses among multiple categories or users, useful for shared expenses with roommates or family members.
2. Recurring Expenses and Incomes: Enable users to set up recurring expenses and incomes, such as monthly bills or salary deposits, so that they are automatically recorded in the system.
3. Data Import/Export: Provide options for users to import data from external sources like bank statements or export their budget data in different formats (CSV, Excel) for backup or analysis in other tools.
4. Expense Filtering and Sorting: Enable users to filter and sort their expense data based on various criteria such as date, category, amount, etc., to facilitate analysis and tracking.
5. Budget Alerts and Reminders: Implement alerts or reminders to notify users when they approach or exceed their budget limits for specific categories or overall budget.
6. Expense Attachments: Allow users to upload and attach receipts or supporting documents to their expense entries for reference and record-keeping.
